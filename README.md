Mathematics and CS projects by Marrero Research, Mathematics Research &amp; Development Company.

---

**Research Focus.**

Discrete mathematics & some CS, but mostly we are focused on Discrete Maths.

---

**Goals.**

This code repository has been created with the objective of showcasing and disseminating our developments and projects. By sharing our work, we aim to foster collaboration and drive innovation in discrete mathematics. We believe that by exploring new theories, applications, coding developments and methodologies, we can contribute to a deeper understanding of discrete structures. 

---

**Methods.**

To date, our research has included not only pure mathematics but also the use of software and programming languages such as Python, Fortran and Wolfram Language (Mathematica). This has enabled us to analyse discrete structures such as integer sequences and graphs, and to generate new knowledge about novel properties and potential applications of these structures. This knowledge could contribute to the established body of mathematical knowledge and supports the development of new mathematical theories.

**Contributions to The Discrete Mathematics and The OEIS (On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences).**

Marrero Research has developed a robust Mathematica code (Wolfram Language) that can reproduce OEIS integer sequences, providing researchers and educators with a convenient and accessible means of accessing and understanding these sequences.

We have successfully indexed several novel sequences in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS.org) and contributed new general formulas that have been incorporated into existing integer sequences already indexed in the OEIS.

* [Github repository dedicated to our work contributed to the OEIS (M-OEIS)](https://github.com/paulfmarrero/M-OEIS)

**Fostering Collaboration.**

Marrero Research also seeks to foster collaboration with computer science disciplines, as this interdisciplinary approach aims to improve research results and the wider applicability of findings across different fields. 

* So you're welcome to collab with us, fellow Dev or Researcher.

---

**Educational Outreach.**

We want to promote mathematical knowledge through educational initiatives. By sharing research findings and methodologies, Marrero Research aims to inspire students and educators who are always seeking to improve mathematics education.
